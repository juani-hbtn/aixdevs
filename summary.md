# Summary of Prompt Strategies and AI Debugging Performance

This report summarizes the findings from our prompt engineering exercise, reflecting on which prompt styles worked best, how AI performance varied by language and error type, best practices learned, and actionable recommendations for future prompt development.

## 1. Effective Prompt Styles

- **Base Prompt (“Senior Developer”)**  
  Worked exceptionally well for **syntax errors** across all three languages (Python, JavaScript, Java). Clear, concise instructions led the AI to quickly pinpoint missing semicolons, misaligned blocks, and unbalanced braces. Average Fix Effectiveness score: **5/5**.
- **File Context + Markdown Blocks**  
  Adding a `file: example.ext` header and enclosing code in markdown fences improved performance on **runtime/logical errors** (e.g., division by zero, out-of-range loops, null pointer). Prompt explicitly asked for a minimal test case, raising Fix Effectiveness from **4 to 5** for those cases and ensuring the AI incorporated error-handling suggestions.
- **Debugging Mentor Role**  
  Switching from “senior developer” to “Debugging Mentor” and requesting step-by-step explanations plus best practices significantly boosted Explanation Quality (from **4 to 5**) in complex scenarios like loop boundaries and null pointer exceptions. This style fostered deeper reasoning and highlighted preventive patterns.

## 2. AI Performance by Language and Error Type

| Language    | Syntax Errors | Runtime/Logical Errors | Notes                                  |
|-------------|---------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Python      | 5/5           | 4.5/5                  | Needed explicit request for zero-division handling. |
| JavaScript  | 5/5           | 4.75/5                 | Out-of-range loop fixed optimally after prompt refinement. |
| Java        | 5/5           | 4.5/5                  | NullPointer fixes improved with mentor style. |

- **Syntax errors**: Consistently perfect detection and correction.
- **Logical/runtime errors**: Improved markedly after iterative prompt refinements, especially when soliciting minimal test cases.

## 3. Best Practices and Insights

1. **Contextualize Code**: Always wrap snippets in language-specific markdown fences and include the filename when possible.  
2. **Solicit Test Cases**: Prompt the AI to propose minimal tests to verify fixes, ensuring robust error resolution.  
3. **Role Specification**: Framing the AI as a “Mentor” rather than just a “Developer” deepens explanations and surfaces best practices.  
4. **Iterative Refinement**: Small tweaks—adding context, role changes, test requests—yield measurable score improvements, highlighting the value of continuous iteration.

## 4. Recommendations for Future Prompt Engineering

- **Standardize Prompt Templates**: Create a library of templates incorporating markdown fences, file context, and test case requests.  
- **Include Example Outputs**: Offer sample corrected code and test cases in the prompt to guide the AI’s responses.  
- **Balance Clarity and Depth**: Use dual roles (“Developer” for direct fixes, “Mentor” for teaching scenarios) based on user needs.  
- **Automate Evaluation**: Integrate scoring scripts to automatically measure Fix Effectiveness and Explanation Quality after each iteration.
