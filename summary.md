# Summary of Prompt Strategies and AI Debugging Performance

This report summarizes the findings from our prompt engineering exercise, reflecting on which prompt styles worked best, how AI performance varied by language and error type, best practices and insights gained, and actionable recommendations for future prompt development.

## 1. Effective Prompt Styles

- **Base Prompt (“Senior Developer”)**  
  Worked exceptionally well for **syntax errors** across Python, JavaScript, and Java. Clear, concise instructions led the AI to quickly pinpoint missing semicolons, misaligned blocks, and unbalanced braces.  
  **Insight:** Direct role framing yields fast, accurate syntax fixes.  
- **File Context + Markdown Blocks**  
  Adding a `file: example.ext` header and enclosing code in markdown fences improved performance on **runtime/logical errors** (division by zero, out-of-range loops, null pointers). Asking for a minimal test case raised Fix Effectiveness from **4 to 5**.  
  **Insight:** Context and testing requirements make fixes more robust.  
- **Debugging Mentor Role**  
  Switching the role to “Debugging Mentor” and requesting step-by-step explanations plus best practices boosted Explanation Quality (from **4 to 5**) on complex scenarios.  
  **Insight:** Mentor framing deepens reasoning and surfaces preventive patterns.

## 2. AI Performance by Language and Error Type

| Language    | Syntax Errors | Runtime/Logical Errors | Notes                                  |
|-------------|---------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Python      | 5/5           | 4.5/5                  | Needed explicit zero-division handling. |
| JavaScript  | 5/5           | 4.75/5                 | Loop boundary fix improved after refinement. |
| Java        | 5/5           | 4.5/5                  | NullPointer fixes improved under mentor style. |

- **Syntax errors**: Perfectly detected and corrected in all languages.  
- **Logical/runtime errors**: Marked improvement after adding context and test case requests.

## 3. Best Practices and Insights

1. **Contextualize Code**: Wrap snippets in language-specific markdown fences and include filenames.  
2. **Solicit Test Cases**: Prompt the AI to propose minimal tests to verify fixes.  
3. **Role Specification**: Use “Mentor” for deep explanations, “Developer” for direct fixes.  
4. **Iterative Refinement**: Small tweaks yield measurable improvements.

**Key Insights:**  
- Context and role both significantly influence AI depth and accuracy.  
- Iteration is essential: continue to refine prompts based on quantitative scores.

## 4. Recommendations for Future Prompt Engineering

- **Standardize Templates**: Build a library of prompts with built-in fences, context, and test requests.  
- **Include Example Outputs**: Supply sample corrected code and tests to guide the AI.  
- **Automate Evaluation**: Integrate scripts that score Fix Effectiveness and Explanation Quality after each adjustment.  
- **Share Insights**: Document lessons learned in each cycle for team knowledge sharing.
