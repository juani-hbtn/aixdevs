# UI Evaluation for ExpenseTracker Mockups (v3)

## 1. Evaluation Criteria (1–5 scale)

| Criterion               | Description                                                                                          |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Visual Hierarchy        | Ease of scanning: clear focal points, use of size/weight/color to guide attention                   |
| Consistency             | Uniform use of typography, colors, iconography, spacing across screens                              |
| Learnability & Flow     | Intuitiveness of navigation and actions; minimal cognitive load for first-time users                |
| Accessibility           | Contrast ratios, font sizes, touch target sizing, semantic clarity                                  |
| Design Pattern Adherence| Alignment with Material Design / platform guidelines (e.g., FAB placement, form field styles)      |

## 2. Heuristic Scores

| Screen           | Visual Hierarchy | Consistency | Learnability & Flow | Accessibility | Pattern Adherence | Notes                                                         |
|------------------|------------------|-------------|---------------------|---------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dashboard        | 4                | 5           | 4                   | 3             | 4                 | Strong cards & FAB; bottom nav added in v3 helps discoverability; contrast on cards could be higher. |
| Add Expense      | 5                | 5           | 5                   | 4             | 5                 | Form layout is clear and follows Material patterns; input labels are legible; date picker accessibility good. |
| History          | 4                | 4           | 4                   | 3             | 4                 | Grouping by date aids flow; swipe targets are correctly sized; text contrast on list items is borderline. |

## 3. Summary of Findings

- **Visual Hierarchy:**  
  - Dashboard: Balance and budget cards stand out, but FAB could use stronger accent color.  
  - Add Expense: Primary action (“Save”) and form fields are prominent.  
  - History: Date headings help segment content, but transaction rows need more distinction.

- **Consistency:**  
  - Typography, icon styles, and spacing are uniform across screens.  
  - v3 bottom navigation bar matches Material guidelines.

- **Learnability & Flow:**  
  - Straightforward first-time flow: Dashboard → Add Expense → History.  
  - Bottom nav improves switching between areas.

- **Accessibility:**  
  - Font sizes meet 16sp minimum, but some secondary text (e.g., timestamps) could be larger.  
  - Contrast ratio on buttons and cards should be tested to ensure ≥4.5:1.

- **Design Pattern Adherence:**  
  - Uses Material Design components (FAB, AppBar, TextFields) appropriately.  
  - Bottom nav and form controls align with Android/iOS guidelines.

## 4. Recommendations

1. **Increase Color Contrast:**  
   - Make card backgrounds and FAB accent color meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast (≥4.5:1).  
2. **Enhance Touch Targets:**  
   - Ensure all interactive elements (icons, list items) have ≥48dp tappable area.  
3. **Augment Visual Distinction in History:**  
   - Alternate row backgrounds or subtle dividers to separate transactions.  
4. **Provide Inline Help:**  
   - Add helper text under form fields for less technical users (e.g., “Tap the calendar icon to pick a date”).  
5. **Accessibility Labels:**  
   - Ensure form controls and buttons have appropriate ARIA/label tags for screen readers.

With these adjustments, the mockups will achieve stronger usability, accessibility, and alignment with design standards.
